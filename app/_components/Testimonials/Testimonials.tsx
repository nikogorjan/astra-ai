And when I talked to him, he said that he takes a picture of the exercise from the workbook, reads the explanation, then hears it again in school and remembers it even better. 😂😂 Looks like we’ll be saving on tutoring this year. 👍💪💙”",

I admit, we were skeptical at first – you know, we don’t have much patience for studying, and you’re usually the one who helps us with that. What can I say, Maya got her first A in math on Thursday. He hugged us. He’s already into technology, and now I often catch him after work learning math instead of playing games. I can see he’s trying. His homework is done. If there’s something he doesn’t understand, he asks us, and we solve the problem together. Please thank the whole team for us.”",
